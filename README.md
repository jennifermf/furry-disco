aka hello world
hello! i have no idea what i'm doing, but i'm fiesty and dedicated and i hope i can figure this out. i've always wanted to learn more coding, but went a totally different route in life... after that route led me down a path that wasn't conducive to my disabilities, here i am learning to code. i took the long way around. thanks for reading this. xo.

a short bio:
a thing i am: a licensed private detective. (no, really!) i'm looking to make the transition into coding, preferably utilizing some of the
things i used to be: a pharmaceuticals chemist (manufacturing and R&D), an explosives chemist, an emergency medical technician, a nursing assistant, a dietician assistant/technician.
