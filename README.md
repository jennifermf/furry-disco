aka hello world
hello! i have no idea what i'm doing, but i'm fiesty and dedicated and i hope i can figure this out. i've always wanted to learn more coding, but went a totally different route in life... after that route led me down a path that wasn't conducive to my disabilities, here i am learning to code. i took the long way around. thanks for reading this. xo.
